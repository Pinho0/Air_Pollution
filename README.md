# R_Small_Projects

## Overview

Welcome to R_Small_Projects! This repository contains a collection of small projects in R that I have worked on. Each project serves as a standalone example of different techniques, concepts, and applications in R programming.

## Repository Structure

Each project is organized in its own directory, typically containing:

R script(s) (.R): The main code files for the project.

Datasets (if applicable): Sample data used in the project, sometimes on the README.md file is the link to the dataset used.

README.md: Project-specific documentation explaining its purpose and functionality.

## How to Use

Clone the repository:

Navigate to a project directory:

Open the R script in RStudio or run it in your R environment.

## Requirements

Ensure you have R installed along with necessary packages.
